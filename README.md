# YoloV3
Here I have used third generation of YOLO(You Only Look Once) with python and openCV for object-detection. 

# To Run 
Run the command\
$python setup.py\
this take a bit of time depending on your internet-speed.\
Now put the video next to the file "yoloV3.py" and name it "video.mp4", then run the command.\
$python yoloV3.py
